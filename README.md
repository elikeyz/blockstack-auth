# Blockstack-Auth

## Project Description

This is a simple web application that utilizes the Blockstack API for user login and authentication. It is a 2-page application that contains a home page and a profile page.

When the user logs in, he/she is redirected to the Blockstack domain to login using his/her Blockstack login credentials. After this is done, the user is then redirected back to the home page which then makes a link available for the user to navigate to his/her profile.

This project was built using React, Bootstrap and Blockstack API. The user's profile details were stored in React Context in order for it to be made available to all the components in the application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation and Usage

To install this application, simply follow these steps:

- Clone this repo
- Install the dependencies with the command `yarn install`.
- Run the application in development mode by running the command `npm start`. After the development server starts up, it will automatically open the application hosted on `localhost:3000` on your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
